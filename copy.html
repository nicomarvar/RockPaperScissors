             1.Get computer input (name:computerPlay)
                1a.Get a random number
                1b.Asign number to a possible game choice
                1c.Get and store the final output
             
             2.Get human input (name: playerSelection)
                2a.Get human player input (prompt)
                2b.Error message if input is not a valid option
                2c.Make that choice case insensitive  
                2d.Get valid Input
                2e.Store the final output
                
             
             3.Comparison and winner output (name:game)
                3a.Compare stored inputs from both players in base of game rules
                3b.Log the results with a message
